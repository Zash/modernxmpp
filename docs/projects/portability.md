# XMPP Account Portability

The _XMPP Account Portability project_ is standardizing a way to migrate a
user’s account data from one XMPP-based service provider or software to
another. The project will develop and publish a suitable protocol and data
format via the [XMPP Standards Foundation](https://xmpp.org/)’s standards
process, as well as a reference implementation. Finally, the work will be
integrated into [Snikket](https://snikket.org/), a suite of XMPP-based
open-source communication software.
